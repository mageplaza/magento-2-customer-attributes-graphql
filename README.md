# Magento 2 Customer Attributes GraphQL/PWA

**Magento 2 Customer Attributes GraphQL is a part of Mageplaza Customer Attributes extension, which offers GraphQL features. This supports PWA compatibility.**

[Mageplaza Customer Attributes for Magento 2](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-customer-attributes/) enables online stores to collect more information from customers with extra essential attributes added to registration or customer account pages.

On the Magento 2 Default, you can only collect some basic information of customers, such as name, date of birth, or tax number that are not helpful at all for your further sales purposes. With Megaplaza Customer Attributes, you can even create unlimited attributes added to the customer registration forms. Attribute properties can be configured easily at the backend. The extension supports 11 different input types, including: 

- Text field 
- Text area
- Date
- Yes/No
- Dropdown
- Multiple Select 
- Single Select with image
- Multi Select with image
- Media image
- Single File Attachment 
- Content 

Magento 2 Customer Attributes enables both store owners and customers to edit the attribute fields easily. Customers can edit the information they fill in the fields. At the same time, store owners can create a new customer account from the admin backend with similar information customers provide from the frontend. With input validation - an advanced feature in this extension, you can set the default types of input so that itâ€™ll prevent the wrong forms of input customers fill in the form. You will totally get the right and useful information from customers without having to confirm with customers and fix them manually. 

Customer Attributes are well compatible with Mageplaza One Step Checkout. All the essential attributes will be added to the checkout page. The store owners can get more information to validate the purchase and process the payment quickly.
